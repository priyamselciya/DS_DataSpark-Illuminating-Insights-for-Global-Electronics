🛠️ Process Overview
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Cleaned datasets using Jupyter Notebooks:
customers_ds_cleaning.ipynb
products_ds_cleaning.ipynb
sales_ds_cleaning.ipynb
store_ds_cleaning.ipynb
exchange_rate_ds_cleaning.ipynb
Converted 'Open Date' columns to datetime format.
Used median imputation to handle missing values and managed outliers.
Loaded cleaned data into MySQL (load_data_to_mysql.ipynb).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance.
Identified key sales drivers, customer preferences, and product success factors.
3. Dashboard Creation (Power BI)
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard using the cleaned datasets.
Dashboard report available as power_bi.pbix.
Summary and insights documented in Power_BI_Report.pdf.
